# Final_Project
This is the code for Project in ML Class

This code is modified from the code given by the google research peoples for their Paper - Graph Clustering By Graph Neural Networks https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16904
I have added the Visualizations for the Synthetic DataSet file - visualize.py
And I have added the implementation of the Spectral Clustering
And The code to generate the SYnthetic Data In the file - sbm.py


For running the train and test for the CORA Dataset run the train.py file

And for running the train and test for the Synthetic DataSet run the train_synthetic.py
